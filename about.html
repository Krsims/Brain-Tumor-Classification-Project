    This project classifies images of brain scans based on the type of tumor present. The tumor classifications are: no tumor, glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, 
and pituitary tumor. The images are fed through a convolutional neural network as arrays to allow for asociations to be made for proper classification. 
The images are appended into lists as x train, y train and x test, y test based on their respective folders. The images are then converted to numpy arrays 
for further processing. The data is split into training and testing sets and the y train and y test are encoded with integer labels. The CNN begins with two 
sets of Conv2D and AveragePooling2D layers with rectified lineal unit (relu) on both convolution layers. Next the data is flattened and input to a relu dense 
layer containing 128 neurons. A dropout layer is present after with a rate of 0.68 (the rate is high due to overfitting issues). The last processing occurs in
a 4 neuron softmax dense layer. The model compiler is optimized with NAdam and loss of Categorical Crossentropy. 

After 9 epochs the results were:
  loss: 0.1838 - accuracy: 0.9346 - val_loss: 0.3201 - val_accuracy: 0.8803
